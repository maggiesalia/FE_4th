              Not every idea was a home run. Storm Thorgerson apparently
              suggested a close-up of a baboon's anus for "Meddle,' before being
              thankfully overruled by Pink Floyd. They instead suggested a photo
              of an ear underwater, and Hipgnosis dispatched photographer Bob
              Dowling.

              Designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis, this
              cover image is actually a photograph of a man sitting in a tree.
              The slide jammed on a 35mm projector while the band was deciding
              which photo to use for the cover, and everybody liked the way it
              completely distorted.

              This iconic image grew out of an initial comment to Hipgnosis
              designers from keyboardist Richard Wright: "Ugh, do we have to
              have one of your bloody surreal designs again?" Before they
              settled on the prism effect, the firm also considered using a
              Silver Surfer-type character.

              A gust of wind blew flames from stuntman Ronnie Rondell's
              flame-retardant suit back into his face on the 15th attempt to
              complete this shoot â€“ prompting the onsite team to douse him with
              extinguishing foam. Luckily, Aubrey Powell already had the final
              image.

              On the first day of the photo shoot for this album, they had an
              incredible sky, but the pig broke free. On the second day, the pig
              stayed put, but the sky was ashen. So, Aubrey Powell deftly
              combined the inflatable from the first shoot with the background
              from the second.

              Cartoonist Gerald Scarfe oversaw the imagery for 'The Wall,' which
              became the first Pink Floyd album not designed by Hipgnosis since
              'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn' after Roger Waters had a falling
              out with Storm Thorgerson. In fact, he wasn't getting along much
              with anybody. Waters exited after one more studio album.
